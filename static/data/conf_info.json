SIGCOMM\u201918 takes a broad view of networking research. This includes new ideas relating to (but not limited to) mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks using a variety of link technologies (wired, wireless, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. It encompasses all aspects of networks and networked systems, including packet-processing hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, sensors, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, topology, robustness and security, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics and evolution, interactions with applications, internet-of-things, novel applications of machine learning to networking, and usability of underlying networking technologies.\r\n\r\nWe want SIGCOMM\u201918 to be daring and emphasize novelty and creativity. The more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all aspects, and the review process will take this into account. We encourage authors to discuss not only the benefits but also the limitations of their ideas.\r\n\r\nUnlike in previous years, SIGCOMM\u201918 will not have a separate experience track. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel networking technologies and systems.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the main conference, SIGCOMM 2018 will have a series of co-located workshops, tutorials, poster and demo sessions, a travel grant program, and conference best paper and SIGCOMM awards.\r\n\r\nSubmissions\r\n\r\nSIGCOMM is a highly selective conference where papers report novel results typically substantiated by experimentation, deployment, simulation, or analysis. Submissions should be in two-column, 10-point format, and can be up to 12 pages in length with as many additional pages as necessary for references. Detailed submission instructions can be found on the conference web site.\r\n\r\nEthical Concerns\r\n\r\nAuthors must as part of the submission process attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one\u2019s institution\u2019s ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient \u2013 in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work.

Papers addressing important challenges in access/communication, energy, computing, security and user experience as it applies to wireless networking and mobile computing form the core of the conference. We also invite submissions on a wide range of mobile computing and wireless networking research, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n    Communications for Embedded and Energy-Harvesting Systems\r\n    Edge Computing\r\n    Long-Range/Low-Power Wide-Area Wireless Networking\r\n    Low-Latency Networking\r\n    Machine-to-Machine Communications\r\n    Millimeter wave and Terahertz Communications\r\n    Mobile Web\r\n    Next-Generation 5G mobile networks\r\n    Visible Light Communications\r\n    Mobile Data Science & Analysis\r\n    Mobile/Wireless Research & Cloud Computing\r\n    Mobile/Wireless Research & Software-Defined Networking\r\n    Sensing with Radio, Light, Sound, and Vibration\r\n    Wearable Computing\r\n\r\nSuccessful papers will address real research challenges through rigorous analysis, novel system design, and/or real-world measurement and deployment of mobile networks, systems and applications. The program committee will evaluate each paper using metrics that are appropriate for the topic area. All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal, and if accepted, papers will be published in the conference proceedings. MobiCom strongly encourages authors to describe how they will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods.\r\n\r\nIn addition to regular, full research papers, the conference also invites submission in the following categories:\r\n\r\nChallenge Papers\r\n\r\nThe conference invites submissions of short papers (limited to eight pages excluding references) that present revolutionary new ideas or that challenge existing assumptions prevalent among the wireless research community. These \"challenge papers\" should provide stimulating ideas or visions that may open up exciting avenues and/or influence the direction of future research. Descriptions of new products or evolution of existing work are not appropriate topics for papers in this category. While an exhaustive evaluation of the proposed ideas is not necessary, insight and in-depth understanding of the issues is expected. Challenge papers will be reviewed by the program committee and if selected, become part of the conference technical program and be published in the conference proceedings. Challenge papers should be submitted using the same submission procedure adopted for the full papers. The title of these papers must bear a \"Challenge:\" prefix\r\n\r\nExperience Papers\r\n\r\nThe conference invites submission of short papers (limited to eight pages excluding references) that present extensive experiences with implementation, deployment, and operations of mobile systems and wireless networks. Desirable papers are expected to contain real data as well as descriptions of the practical lessons learned. The experience papers will be evaluated by the program committee, primarily for (i) richness of their data or experiences, (ii) inferences drawn or lessons learned, (iii) discovery of new problems, and (iv) their impact/potential impact on current and future mobile systems and wireless networks, as well as on society. Note that a paper that builds a system and presents a limited experimental evaluation is NOT suitable as an experience paper. Selected experience papers will become a part of the conference technical program and will be publishedin the conference proceedings. Experience papers should be submitted according to the same submission procedure as full papers, and their title must bear an \"Experience:\" prefix.\r\n\r\nVerification Papers\r\n\r\nMobiCom welcomes contributions that seek to verify and/or characterize recent breakthrough results in mobile computing using rigorous experimental methodologies with the goal of extensively and thoroughly characterizing the operating parameters under which these results can be reproduced. Such submissions should be short papers (limited to eight pages excluding references) with \"Verification:\" as a prefix in the title. Selected verification papers will become a part of the conference technical program and will be published in the conference proceedings.

Full details of submission procedures and requirements for authors of accepted papers are available at http://infocom2020.ieee-infocom.org. \r\n\r\nTo encourage authors to submit their best work to the conference and to reduce unnecessary burden on the reviewers, we limit each individual to submit as author or co-author on no more than 8 papers. In the event that an individual submits more than 8 papers, the first 8 valid submissions (based on the order of paper registration) from that author will be accepted into the review process and the remainder will be rejected without review.\r\n\r\nPaper submission link on EDAS is: https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=25772\r\n\r\nOriginality\r\n\r\nOnly original papers that have not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere will be considered. Technical Papers must be submitted via the EDAS Paper Processing System (https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=25772). \r\n\r\nDouble blind submissions\r\n\r\nAll submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind reviewing, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Common sense and careful writing will go a long way towards preserving anonymity. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review.\r\n\r\nMinimally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:\r\n\r\nRemove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page.\r\nRemove acknowledgments of identifying names and funding sources.\r\nRemove project titles or names that can be used to trace back to the authors via a web search engine.\r\nUse care in naming your files. Source file names (e.g., \"Alice-n-Bob.dvi\") are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments.\r\n\r\nUse care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer incapable of grasping the context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author. For example, instead of \"In prior work [3], we presented a routing protocol that ...,\" sentences in the spirit of \"In prior work, Smith and Clark [3] presented a routing protocol that ...\" should be used. With this method, the full citation to Smith and Clark can still be given, such as \"[3] J. Smith, A. Clark, \"Analysis of...\", and it is not acceptable to say \"[3] Reference deleted for double-blind review.\"\r\n\r\nThe submitted manuscript or its title/abstract should not be posted on a public website, such as arxiv.org, or transmitted via public mailing lists.\r\n\r\nThe submitted manuscript (PDF file) should be text-searchable. Any submission that does not meet this requirement may be returned without review.\r\n\r\nMany of the editing tools automatically add metadata to the generated PDF file containing information that may violate the double blind policy. Please remove any possible metadata that can link your manuscript to you. This includes removing names, affiliation, license numbers etc. from the Metadata as well as from the paper. Failing to meet this requirement may also lead to a rejection without review.\r\n\r\nRemove any embedded author/affiliation information in the PDF metadata. Go to Acrobat menu File/Properties\u2026 and remove any author information there.\r\n \r\nLength and formatting requirements\r\n\r\nSubmitted papers must be written in the English language, with a maximum length limit of 10 printed pages. Main text (including figures, tables, appendices, and any material other than references) must be no more than 9 pages. Papers that do not comply with the length limit will not be reviewed. Use the standard IEEE Transactions templates for Microsoft Word or LaTeX formats found at: https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html. If the paper is typeset in LaTeX, please use an unmodified version of the LaTeX template IEEEtran.cls version 1.8, and use the preamble:\r\n\r\n\\documentclass[10pt, conference, letterpaper]{IEEEtran}\r\n\r\nDo not use additional LaTeX commands or packages to override and change the default typesetting choices in the template, including line spacing, font sizes, margins, space between the columns, and font types. This implies that the manuscript must use 10-point Times font, two-column formatting, as well as all default margins and line spacing requirements as dictated by the original version of IEEEtran.cls version 1.8."]], "NSDI": [["a", "NSDI", "USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation", "2019-09-12", "2019-12-13", "2020-02-25", "303"], ["NSDI 2020: USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation", "https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20", {"Submission Date": "2019-09-12", "Notification Date": "2019-12-13", "Conference Date": "2020-02-25", "Location": "Santa Clara, California, USA", "Years": "17"}, "Overview\r\n\r\nNSDI focuses on the design principles, implementation, and practical evaluation of networked and distributed systems. Our goal is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community to foster a broad approach to addressing overlapping research challenges.\r\n\r\nNSDI provides a high-quality, single-track forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further the knowledge and understanding of the networked systems community as a whole, continue a significant research dialog, or push the architectural boundaries of network services.\r\n\r\nTopics\r\n\r\nWe solicit papers describing original and previously unpublished research. Specific topics of interest include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n    Highly available and reliable networked systems\r\n    Security and privacy of networked systems\r\n    Distributed storage, caching, and query processing systems\r\n    Energy-efficient computing in networked systems\r\n    Cloud/multi-tenant systems\r\n    Mobile and embedded/sensor applications and systems\r\n    Wireless networked systems\r\n    Network and workload measurement systems\r\n    Self-organizing, autonomous, and federated networked systems\r\n    Managing, debugging, and diagnosing problems in networked systems\r\n    Virtualization and resource management for networked systems\r\n    Systems aspects of networking hardware\r\n    Experience with deployed networked systems\r\n    Communication and computing over big data on networked systems\r\n    Practical aspects of economics and verification applied to networked systems\r\n    Any innovative solution for a significant problem involving networked systems\r\n\r\nLike NSDI 2019, we are offering two submission deadlines, and we are providing the possibility of getting one-shot-revision decisions in lieu of rejection. To see a detailed explanation of the expected benefits from these changes, see Additional Information about Multiple Deadlines Process.\r\n\r\nTwo Deadlines\r\n\r\nNSDI \u201920 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines. Any paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the subsequent reviewing period will be presented at the conference and will appear as part of the proceedings. In the meantime, authors are permitted to advertise their papers as accepted by NSDI, for example listing them on CVs.\r\n\r\nA paper submitted at the spring deadline for NSDI '20 and rejected may not be submitted again until the spring deadline for NSDI '21. A paper submitted at the fall deadline for NSDI '20 and rejected may not be submitted again until the fall deadline for NSDI '21.\r\n\r\nOne-Shot Revision\r\n\r\nEach paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. Such a revision decision includes a summary of the paper's merits and a list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted at NSDI. Authors may then submit a version of their work addressing those needs during the subsequent deadline. At that point, the paper will be reviewed to judge whether it addresses the requirements requested; this review will be conducted, to the extent possible, by the same reviewers as earlier. To enable this, PC members who give one-shot-revision decisions late in a year are obligated to participate as external reviewers in the following year to review those papers' resubmissions, which would be considered for the following year's conference. Papers revised and re-submitted following a one-shot-revision decision can only receive a decision of accept or reject, not revise; this is what makes revisions \"one-shot.\"\r\n\r\nThe judgment about whether to accept a revised paper will be made as follows. Reviewers will primarily judge whether the authors have satisfied the requests accompanying the revision decision. They will also judge the resubmission on its independent merits, but should avoid rejecting it for non-fatal concerns that they could have raised during the first round of reviews. The reviewers should also ensure that the revised paper doesn't introduce new assertions without sufficient support. Unlike the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results, e.g., comparing performance against a certain alternative and beating it by at least 10%.\r\n\r\nDuring the revision period, the paper is still considered under review to NSDI and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. To make this obligation clear, authors who receive a one-shot-revision notification must, within two weeks of the notification, explicitly send an email acknowledging their participation in the one-shot-revision process. That e-mail should indicate they understand that this means the USENIX Submission Policy precludes concurrent submission to other conferences.\r\n\r\nTo make a one-shot-revision decision, reviewers must be comfortable accepting the paper if the authors make all the changes requested in it. Most notably, if a paper makes an insufficient contribution, or is incremental, then it should be rejected, not given a one-shot-revision decision. After all, the point of one-shot revision is not to produce highly-polished uninteresting papers, but rather to allow publication of exciting work that's unfortunately submitted in a form that's flawed in a way that can't be fixed with mere shepherding.\r\n\r\nReviewers will also be instructed to not offer a one-shot-revision option if they can't determine that the paper is adequate modulo the proposed revisions. For instance, if the paper is written so sloppily that there may be a hidden deep flaw, then the paper should be rejected, not given a one-shot-revision request to fix the inadequate writing.\r\n\r\nAuthors given a one-shot-revision decision will be sent, within a few days of the decision, detailed instructions about how to re-submit. These instructions will include the list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted. They will also explain how the authors should accompany their re-submission with auxiliary material to demonstrate how they've satisfied that list of changes. This auxiliary material will consist of (1) an additional version of the re-submission in which revision changes since the first submission are clearly marked, and (2) a separate textual explanation of the high-level differences between the two versions.\r\n\r\nIf authors receive a one-shot-revision decision but don't want to submit a revised version, they may withdraw it. In this case, they may not submit the paper to NSDI again until 11 months after the deadline they originally it submitted to.\r\n\r\nIf authors receive a one-shot-revision decision for a paper submitted to the fall deadline of NSDI \u201820, this gives them the option to make the requested changes and re-submit it to the next NSDI deadline, which is the first deadline of NSDI '21. If the paper is accepted then, it will appear at NSDI '21, not NSDI '20.\r\n\r\nOperational Systems Track\r\n\r\nIn addition to papers that describe original research, NSDI '20 also solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with large-scale, operational systems and networks. We encourage submission of papers that disprove or strengthen existing assumptions, deepen the understanding of existing problems, and validate known techniques at scales or environments in which they were never used or tested before. Such operational papers need not present new ideas or results to be accepted; indeed, new ideas or results will not influence whether the papers are accepted. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for operational systems track papers. Since the evaluation of operational systems track papers requires understanding the real-world use of the system, papers in this track will be reviewed in a more limited double-blind process. Authors' names should be withheld, as usual. However, in contrast to other papers, authors need not anonymize the content of their submission in any other way\u2014they may keep company names, links, real system names, etc. as appropriate for the paper. Please note that you cannot switch tracks for your paper after submission since the submission rules differ.\r\n\r\nAuthors should indicate on the title page of the paper and in the submission form that they are submitting to this track.\r\n\r\nThe final program will make no distinction between papers accepted from this track and papers accepted from the regular track.\r\n\r\nWhat to Submit\r\n\r\nNSDI '20 is double-blind, meaning that authors should make a good faith effort to anonymize papers. Note that the operational track papers have different rules as described above. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left de-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. Please take the following steps when preparing your submission:\r\n\r\n    Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page.\r\n    Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources.\r\n    Do not provide links to your own online content. If this online content is critical to the content of your paper, please see the submission form, which allows for some forms of content upload, or contact the PC chairs.\r\n    Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments.\r\n    Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. If you cite anonymous work, you will need to enter the deanonymized reference(s) on the online submission form.\r\n    If you need to reference another submission at NSDI '20 on a related topic, reference it as follows: \"A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [Anonymous 2020].\" with the corresponding citation: \"[Anonymous 2020] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.\"\r\n    Work that extends an author's previous workshop paper is welcome, but the paper should (a) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation and (b) explain the differences between the NSDI submission and the prior workshop paper. The online submission form will also require authors to submit the deanonymized citation and a short explanation of the differences from the prior workshop paper.\r\n    Blinding is not intended to be a great burden. If blinding your paper seems too burdensome, please contact the program co-chairs and discuss your specific situation.\r\n\r\nSubmissions\u2014as well as final papers\u2014must be no longer than 12 pages, including footnotes, figures, and tables. Submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for references and for supplementary material in appendices. The paper should stand alone without the supplementary material, but authors may use this space for content that may be of interest to some readers but is peripheral to the main technical contributions of the paper. Note that members of the program committee are free to not read this material when reviewing the paper.\r\n\r\nSubmissions must be in two-column format, using 10-point type on 12-point (single-spaced) leading, in a text block 7\" wide x 9\" deep, with .33\" inter-column space, formatted for 8.5\" x 11\" paper.\r\n\r\nPapers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review, and no deadline extensions will be granted for reformatting. Pages should be numbered, and figures and tables should be legible when printed without requiring magnification. Authors may use color in their figures, but the figures should be readable when printed in black and white. If you wish, you may use the template for LaTeX available on the conference paper templates page. All papers must be submitted via the submission form. Please do not email submissions.

Short papers are the preferred vehicle for contributions whose novelty and impact show the same technical excellence, but whose description fits within 6 pages (one additional page for appendices and unlimited pages for references). Short papers will be reviewed with a more open mind towards the scope of evaluation or breadth of topics compared to long papers. Note that position papers, critiques of networking research, and ideas that are not yet fully complete or evaluated are a better fit for the HotNets workshop. We recommend that authors check both call for papers before submitting.\r\n\r\nWe welcome experience submissions that clearly articulate lessons learned, as well as submissions that refute prior published results. We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work.\r\n\r\nEthical concerns\r\n\r\nCoNEXT accords great importance to research ethics. Specifically, authors must attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Submitting research for approval by one\u2019s institution\u2019s ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient. The PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work whenever it has concerns about the ethics of a submission. Authors agree to be available at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical standards.

IWQoS 2017 sets the goal to continuing to be a premier symposium and an international forum for presentation and discussion of cutting-edge research in the field. The scope of IWQoS 2017 covers both newest theoretical and experimental research papers.\r\n\r\nBesides regular papers, this year, IWQoS includes the Work-in-Progress track inviting papers presenting new talent, risky ideas, and new subjects to be discussed in a creative and inspiring atmosphere of the event. It is a lively forum to discuss work among each other and with senior researchers, with a special focus on work in progress, upcoming research challenges, and new directions in the field of QoS.\r\n\r\nTopics of interest include QoS issues in (but not limited to) the following areas:\r\n\r\n    Quality of services in Internet of things\r\n    Quality of cloud services and cloud computing\r\n    Quality of mobile cloud services and fog computing\r\n    Quality of protection, user experience, security and privacy\r\n    Quality of services in software-defined networking\r\n    Quality of services in information-centric networking\r\n    Quality of services in DTN, mobile and next generation cellular networking\r\n    Quality of services in information-centric networking\r\n    Quality of service in physical networks\r\n    System dependability, availability, resilience and robustness to faults and security attacks\r\n    Robustness against security vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures\r\n    Scheduling, resource management, queue management, admission control\r\n    Traffic engineering approaches and tools for provisioning and evaluation\r\n    Quality evaluation metrics and methodologies\r\n    QoS parsing, identification and control\r\n    Quality of software\r\n    Quality of experience in multimedia networks\r\n    Measurement, evaluation, adaptation and verification\r\n    Network operations, pricing and billing, network and service management\r\n    Architectures and protocols for IP, overlay and peer-to-peer networks, optical networks, wireless, ad hoc, mesh, and sensor networks\r\n    Energy awareness in communication systems\r\n    Design for future networks and computing systems with QoS in mind\r\n\r\nRegular Paper Submission Guidelines:\r\n\r\nIWQoS invites submission of manuscripts with original research results that have not been previously published or that are not currently under review by another conference or journal.

Short papers could articulate a high-level vision and describe challenging future directions that the authors believe the community should tackle; validate, verify, or update important results; or present new ideas that challenge existing assumptions.\r\n\r\nAny submission exceeding short paper page-length limit will be evaluated as a full paper.\r\n\r\nAuthors should only submit original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. We will consider full paper submissions that extend previously published short, preliminary papers (including IMC short papers) following the model of the ACM SIGCOMM policy.\r\n\r\nIMC 2019 will bestow two awards on paper submissions, a Best Paper award and a Community Contribution award. The best paper award will recognize the outstanding paper at the conference, and all accepted papers are eligible for it. The community contribution award will recognize a paper with an outstanding contribution to the community in the form of a novel dataset, source code distribution, open platform, or other noteworthy service to the community. To be eligible for the community award, the authors must make publicly available their dataset (e.g., through DatCat for Internet measurement data or CRAWDAD for wireless data) or source code (e.g., via GitHub, Bitbucket), or have an open working platform, etc., by the camera-ready deadline. The authors indicate their eligibility on the submission form and are also encouraged to include a link to the contribution in the submitted paper itself.\r\n\r\nEthical Considerations\r\n\r\nPapers describing experiments with users or sensitive user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information) must follow basic precepts of ethical research and subscribe to community norms. These include: respect for privacy, secure storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if users are placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential, beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), and risk mitigation. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report for further information on ethical principles and the Allman/Paxson IMC 07 paper for guidance on ethical data sharing.\r\n\r\nNote that submitting research for approval by each author\u2019s institutional ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient \u2013 in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will consider the ethical soundness and justification of any paper, just as it does its technical soundness. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and authors agree to be available at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical considerations. Authors unsure about ethical issues are welcome to contact the program committee co-chairs at imc2019pcchairs@sigcomm.org.\r\n\r\nIMC 2019 Shadow PC\r\n\r\nTo provide an educational experience by exposing students to a review process and to subsequently train the next generation of program committee (PC) members, the ACM IMC 2019 TPC would like to make submitted papers available to the shadow PC. Shadow PCs allow students and others interested in future PC service to read submitted papers and go through the reviewing process, ultimately arriving at a shadow conference program. This opportunity allows future PC members to learn first-hand about the peer-review process and gain experience as a reviewer.\r\n\r\nThe shadow PC process is run on a different system and the shadow PC reviewers will not have any access to the real reviews, the names of the real reviewers, or any other data such as relative rankings. Shadow PC reviewers will have to abide by the same rules and restrictions applicable to regular PC members.

HotNets provides a venue for discussing innovative ideas and for debating future research agendas in networking.\r\n\r\nWe invite researchers and practitioners to submit short position papers. We encourage papers that identify fundamental open questions, advocate a new approach, offer a constructive critique of the state of networking research, re-frame or debunk existing work, report unexpected early results from a deployment, report on promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Novel ideas need not be supported by full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations can support the possibility of the paper\u2019s claims.\r\n\r\nWe seek early-stage work, where the authors can benefit from community feedback. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry for the community that results in multiple conference papers in related venues (SIGCOMM, SOSP, OSDI, NSDI, MobiCom, MobiSys, CoNEXT, etc.), rather than a single follow-on conference paper. The program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion over \u201cconference papers in miniature\u201d. Finished work that fits in a short paper is likely a better fit with the short-paper tracks at either CoNEXT or IMC, for example.\r\n\r\nHotNets takes a broad view of networking research. This includes new ideas relating to (but not limited to) mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks using a variety of link technologies (wired, wireless, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. It encompasses all aspects of networks, including (but not limited to) packet-processing hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, topology, robustness and security, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics and evolution, interactions with applications, and usability of underlying networking technologies.\r\n\r\nPosition papers will be selected based on originality, likelihood of stimulating insightful discussion at the workshop, and technical merit. Accepted papers will be posted online prior to the workshop and will be published in the ACM Digital Library to facilitate wide dissemination of the ideas discussed at the workshop.\r\n\r\nPolicy on Concurrent Submissions\r\n\r\nConcurrent submissions to HotNets 2019 and any other peer-reviewed venue that cover the same work (differences in degree of detail given the two venues\u2019 length limits notwithstanding) are prohibited, and will result in the rejection of the HotNets submission in question. \u201cConcurrent\u201d means any other peer-reviewed venue whose reviewing period (i.e., between submission and notification) overlaps with that of HotNets. The \u201csame work\u201d means, for example, a submission overlapping significantly in content with a conference submission. However, a position paper submitted to HotNets (e.g., that reflects broadly on the state of some aspect of the field, adopts a position as to how the field should move forward, or articulates a broad avenue of future work) will not be considered the \u201csame work\u201d as a conference-length paper on a specific system that addresses a point under the broad umbrella covered by the position paper. Authors with questions about the concurrent submission policy are encouraged to contact the PC chairs prior to submitting.\r\n\r\nEthical Concerns\r\n\r\nAs part of the submission process, authors must attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one\u2019s institution\u2019s ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient \u2013 in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and authors agree to be available at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical standards.\r\n\r\nWorkshop Participation\r\n\r\nHotNets attendance is limited to roughly 90 people, to facilitate lively discussion. Invitations will be allocated first to one author of each paper, HotNets organizers and committee members, and conference sponsors. To promote an inclusive workshop, HotNets will also make a limited number of open registration slots available to the community. "]]}
