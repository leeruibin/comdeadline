It is the prime ACM journal in the field. Multimedia is now a mature area, having evolved over approximately 20 years. The term \u201cmedia\u201d traditionally referred to entities such as audio, video, text, images, graphics, animation. New media will be added in the future, including virtual reality, holography, haptics, eSmell, eTaste, eThought, \u2026. The term \u201cmultimedia\u201d has now been accepted to mean documents composed of at least two correlated media. The correlation could be temporal, spatial or semantic. Applications now appear in many fields such as entertainment, publishing, advertising, banking, insurance, e-commerce, travel, medical, defense, training, geographical information systems, weather and many others.\r\n \r\nTOMCCAP is soliciting paper submissions on all aspects of multimedia, as defined above, including systems, devices, signal processing and coding, graphics, databases, retrieval, networking and applications. Papers on single media (audio, video, animation, haptics,..), their processing, networking  and applications are also welcome. However, papers covering a single algorithm or aspect of one specific kind of media only (like e.g. image compression algorithms) are likely to be rejected.\r\n\r\nOf special interest are papers on the following three major challenges: (i) new authoring tools that make authoring complex multimedia as easy as using a word processor or a drawing program, (ii) applications that make interactions with remote people and environments nearly the same as interactions with local people and environments and (iii) multimedia systems that make capturing, storing, finding, and using digital media an everyday occurrence in our computing environment. Papers on new integrated media, including virtual reality, haptics, holography, eSmell, eTaste, eThought are also highly encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe transactions consists primarily of research papers. This is an archival journal and it is intended that the papers will have lasting importance and value over time. In general, papers whose primary focus is on particular multimedia products will not be included.\r\n\r\nThe journal accepts publications in the three general subfields of multimedia computing, communications, and applications, each consisting of various areas of research.

Internet is the core of today's computer-communication infrastructures. This has transformed the Internet, from a robust network for data transfer between computers, to a global, content-rich, communication and information system where contents are increasingly generated by the users, and distributed according to human social relations. Next-generation network technologies, architectures and protocols are therefore required to overcome the limitations of the legacy Internet and add new capabilities and services. The future Internet should be ubiquitous, secure, resilient, and closer to human communication paradigms.\r\n\r\nComputer Communications is a peer-reviewed international journal that publishes high-quality scientific articles (both theory and practice) and survey papers covering all aspects of future computer communication networks (on all layers, except the physical layer), with a special attention to the evolution of the Internet architecture, protocols, services, and applications. Topics include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n    Emerging technologies for next generation network\r\n    LAN/WAN/MAN\r\n    Future Internet architecture, protocols and services\r\n    Content- and service-centric architecture\r\n    Mobile and ubiquitous networks\r\n    Self organizing/autonomic networking\r\n    Green networking\r\n    Internet content search\r\n    QoS and multimedia networking\r\n    Opportunistic networking\r\n    On-line social networks\r\n    Internet of things\r\n    Public safety communication networks\r\n    Network applications (web, multimedia streaming, VoIP, gaming, etc.)\r\n    Trust, security and privacy in computer and communication networks\r\n    Modeling, measurement and simulation\r\n    Complex network models\r\n    Internet socio-economic models\r\n    Experimental test-beds and research platforms\r\n    Algorithmic aspects of communication networks\r\n    Network scaling and limits"]]}
